# KYC-Automation
**Project Overview:** Our team of four has developed an innovative KYC Automation system designed to streamline and automate the Know Your Customer (KYC) validation process. Our primary goal is to minimize manual intervention, thus enhancing efficiency and accuracy in customer onboarding.

## Key Features:

- **Automated Validation:** Users can easily submit their personal details, recent photographs, and scans of their Aadhaar ID (both front and back) via a user-friendly web form.
- **Intelligent Matching:** The system employs facial recognition technology to compare the photo on the Aadhaar card with the user's submitted photograph, ensuring identity consistency.
- **Data Extraction and Verification:** Using Tesseract OCR, the solution extracts all pertinent information from the Aadhaar card. This data is then cross-referenced and validated against the UIDAI database for authenticity.
- **Final Onboarding:** A customer is onboarded only after a successful match of all the data points, ensuring a thorough and reliable verification process.
